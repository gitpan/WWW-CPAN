=head1 NAME

cpanq - A CLI interface to WWW::CPAN

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cpanq search Foo
  cpanq search query=File::Temp mode=all

  cpanq meta Foo
  cpanq meta dist=WWW-CPAN version=0.003

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script runs a simple interface to execute
API methods of L<WWW::CPAN> via the command line.
Currently, this is a work in progress and
offered more like an example code for C<WWW::CPAN>.

The actual implementation code lives in the
module L<App::WWW::CPAN>.

The expected arguments for the script are like:

  command single-arg
  command key1=val1 key2=val2

where the supported commands by now are B<search>
and B<meta>.

  search Foo # translates to WWW::CPAN->search('Foo')
  search query=File::Temp mode=all # WWW::CPAN->search({ query => 'File::Temp', mode => 'all' });

  meta Foo # WWW::CPAN->fetch_distmeta('Foo');
  meta dist=WWW-CPAN version=0.003 # WWW::CPAN->fetch_distmeta({ dist => 'WWW-CPAN', version => '0.003' })

There are also the synonym commands: B<query>
which is the same as B<search> and B<distmeta>
an alias of B<meta>.

The results are dumped with the help of
L<Data::Dump::Streamer> into STDOUT.

=head1 FEATURES

Since 0.007 version, B<cpanq> uses a cache to
avoid hitting search.cpan.org with the same query
in a very short time period. This cache lives at
F<~/.cpanq> (or platform-equivalent home directory).
The expiration actually happens after 10 minutes.

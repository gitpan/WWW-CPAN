DESCRIPTION
    Blame Schwern.

      [LINK HERE]

    Just kidding. I just appropriated Schwern's idea and Graham's work. I am
    lazy -- but that's supposed to be a quality.

      Subject: META.json:  CPAN as a web service

      I asked Graham if he'd consider providing META.json auto-conversion for
      META.yml files so we can start playing with CPAN data in Javascript.

      Well here you are:
      http://search.cpan.org/meta/Error/META.json

      Specific versions work:
      http://search.cpan.org/meta/Error-0.17009/META.json

      You can request the META file as YAML:
      http://search.cpan.org/meta/Error/META.yml

      And even ask for information about the last release of a distribution by a
      particular author.
      http://search.cpan.org/meta/gbarr/Error/META.yml

      As a special bonus feature, Graham added auto generation of META for
      distributions which don't have them!  For example, that last META file.  It
      includes bonus information like the CPAN Forum, Testers, Tools and rt.cpan.org
      resource links.

      CPAN distribution data is now available as a web service.  Everybody say
      "thank you, Graham"!

        - try Cache::FileCache rather than Cache::File:
          it seems to work on Windows (at least more than
          Cache::File does)

        - experiment LWP::UserAgent::Determined to get
          rid of some failures in live test
        - dependency on LWP::UserAgent replaced by 
          L::UA::Determined for now
        - nope, it won't help: search.cpan.org is playing
          tricks on me - the META.json of CPAN
          is auto-generated sometimes instead of
          being the one extracted from the current dist
